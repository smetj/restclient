Restclient
==========

A helper library to make writing REST clients in python extremely
simple. Specifically, while httplib2 and similar libraries are very
efficient and powerful, doing something very simple like making a POST
request to a url with a couple parameters can involve quite a bit of
code. Restclient tries to make these common tasks simple. It does not
try to do everything though. If you need to construct a request in a
very particular way, are expecting a large result, or need better
error handling, nothing is stopping you from using one of the lower
level libraries directly for that. 

Installation
============

If you have setuptools installed, just do "easy_install restclient"


Documentation
=============

Restclient is very simple so the main documentation is in docstrings in the code itself. this page just serves as a quick starter.


    from restclient import GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    r = GET("http://www.example.com/") # makes a GET request to the url. returns a string 
    POST("http://www.example.com/") # makes a POST request
    PUT("http://www.example.com/") # makes a PUT request
    DELETE("http://www.example.com/") # makes a DELETE request
    POST("http://www.example.com/",params={'foo' : 'bar'}) # passes params along
    POST("http://www.example.com/",headers={'foo' : 'bar'}) # sends additional HTTP headers with the request
    POST("http://www.example.com/",accept=['application/xml','text/plain']) # specify HTTP Accept: headers
    POST("http://www.example.com/",credentials=('username','password')) # HTTP Auth
    POST("http://www.example.com/",raw='["one","two",{"last":"three"}]',accept=['application/json','text/plain']) # define and submit a raw body as content

Restclient also handles multipart file uploads nicely:

    f = open("foo.txt").read()
    POST("http://www.example.com/",files={'file1' : {'file' : f, 'filename' : 'foo.txt'}})


by default, POST(), PUT(), and DELETE() make their requests asynchronously. IE, they spawn a new thread to do the request and return immediately. GET() is synchronous. You can change this behavior with the 'async' parameter:

    POST("http://www.example.com/",async=False) # will wait for the request to complete before returning

Doing an asynchronous GET would be silly and pointless so I won't give an example of that but I'm sure you could figure it out.

With any of those, if you add a return_resp=True argument, restclient
will make the request like normal and then return the raw httplib2
response object. You'll have to extract the response body yourself,
but you'll also have access to the HTTP response codes, etc.

For finer grained control over the httplib2 library use the keyword 'httplib_params' to supply a dict of key/value pairs.  This will be passed unadulterated as parameters to httplib2.Http().
